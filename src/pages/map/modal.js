          Humanity is moving ever deeper into crisis â€” a crisis without precedent.

          First, it is a crisis brought about by cosmic evolution irrevocably intent 
          upon completely transforming omnidisintegrated humanity from a complex 
          of around-the-world, remotely-deployed-from-one-another, differently colored,
          differently credoed, differently cultured, differently communicating, 
          and differently competing entities into a completely integrated, comprehensively
          interconsiderate, harmonious whole.
