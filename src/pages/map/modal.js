        Humanity is moving ever deeper into crisis — a crisis without precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it is a crisis brought about by cosmic evolution irrevocably intent 
        upon completely transforming omnidisintegrated humanity from a complex 
        of around-the-world, remotely-deployed-from-one-another, differently colored,
        differently credoed, differently cultured, differently communicating, 
        and differently competing entities into a completely integrated, comprehensively
        interconsiderate, harmonious whole.
