In England more than 1 million homes <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/housing-backlog-more-million-homes-planning-permission-not-yet-built\">with planning permission remain unbuilt</a>. With housing delivery in the UK dominated by private house builders who benefit from limiting supply to drive up prices, there is a financial incentive to slow down building which leaves development sites vacant for longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Complexities in land ownership</strong> can also halt potential developments in their tracks. Sometimes a small piece of land as narrow as six inches (known as a ‘ransom strip’), or the rights to access by others (known as an easement or wayleave) can scupper an ideal location for new homes. Overcoming these issues can require reluctant owners to play ball and overlook market interests.</p>\n<p><strong>A lack of trust in developers</strong> often characterised as NIMBYism (‘Not-In-My-Back-Yard’). In reality however, local opposition is the product of an erosion in trust between developers and local authorities who often fail to listen and respond to the concerns of local residents, with a focus on ‘units’ and parking, rather than thinking about making great places that people want to live in. Trust in developers to work with, rather than against communities is at an <a href=\"https://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/98-of-public-dont-trust-developers-research-shows/5100575.article\">all time low</a>, whilst a study by UCL looking into the design of new housing by major private developers classed 75% of schemes as “overwhelmingly ‘mediocre’ or ‘poor’.”</p>\n<p><strong>Physical barriers to a site</strong> such as poor access, existing services or contamination are other common features of vacant infill sites. Our experience conducting a detailed feasibility study for four new social homes on a garage site in East Oxford has shown that often there is a sound reason a site has been untouched. In this case we found a major water pipe running through the site. But it might be anything from a sewage pipe or drainage channel, to limited access for refuse trucks, emergency services, or the inability to offload materials and components. We’ve learned the hard way that undertaking extensive surveys and assessments by the right professionals at the start of the project is the best way to avoid abortive work later down the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Poor supply chains</strong> is another major barrier that Transition by Design has experienced first-hand and which has been <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/brexit-how-will-it-affect-the-house-builder-supply-chain-61816\">reported on widely in the press</a> and by <a href=\"https://www.ribaj.com/intelligence/disrupted-materials-supply-chain-threatens-construction-bouncback-lockdown-brexit\">industry</a>. This makes it a challenge to find the right professionals and to source the materials and components needed. The combination of COVID-19 and Brexit has caused already fragile supply chains to falter and prices to spiral. A skilled and available workforce and a lack of access to essential materials and quality components have both played a significant part in hampering more innovative house building approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>An unsupportive policy framework -</strong> The Government White Paper <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958420/MHCLG-Planning-Consultation.pdf\"><em>Planning for the Future</em></a> last year acknowledged the challenges faced for small house builders and small sites, based on a complex and cumbersome one-size fits-all system planning system and declared its desire to support innovative developers and housebuilders, as well as more diverse approaches. <a href=\"https://lichfields.uk/media/6180/small-sites-unlocking-housing-delivery_sep-2020.pdf\">Lichfields has offered a neat list of practical recommendations</a> for how policy could make it quicker and easier to obtain planning of small sites.</p>\n<p>In early 2021, a consultation was initiated on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/right-to-regenerate-to-turn-derelict-buildings-into-homes-and-community-assets\">Right to Regenerate</a>, which could further reduce the barriers for communities to access small parcels of land. There is a widespread desire for change from the bottom-up and the top-down, what is needed now is to see this desire put into action.</p>\n<p>These six common barriers suggest how vacant and infill sites can be more complex, require extra creativity and often fail to compete financially when compared against the economic logic of volume house builders, who fail to consider the long term economic, social, and environmental impacts on people and place.</p>\n<p>Both private developers and local authorities are often locked into a historic approach to housing as if it were the only way, but in reality, there are examples up and down the country springing up that show us an alternative is possible.</p>\n<p>From Citu’s Climate Innovation District in Leeds which is turning a central brownfield site into a resilient, green, mixed-use neighbourhood of 516 low energy homes with integrated amenities; or Igloo’s Trent Basin in Nottingham, a 350-home waterside regeneration which included the creation of a Community Fund, a new Residents’ Association, community renewable energy scheme and a new riverside walk. These are design-led developments built within cities focused on placemaking and striving to meet local needs.</p>\n<p>If you’d like more detail, you might also be interested in watching the recording of an online roundtable discussion we hosted in November 2021 which brought together practitioners form Bristol and Oxford to share knowledge on unlocking small urban development sites.
