As a result we have seen very few examples coming forward in Oxford to date. </p>\n<p>In this roundtable discussion, recorded in November 2021 we explored the challenges and opportunities for unlocking sites in Oxford, how they could help the city's growing housing need drawing on inspiration from other cities leading the way. The session began with a brief provocation from Jacqueline Miller from Bristol City Council, part of the Innovate UK, Demonstrator Project: Enabling Housing Innovation, who are leading the charge with new and creative approaches to unlocking tricky sites across Bristol City. </p>\n<p>The following discussion was then split into three parts, </p>\n<p>1. The challenges to unlocking sites in Oxford - what are the perceived and real barriers to development? </p>\n<p>2. The opportunities for transforming sites - what is the role of Modern methods of Construction (MMC) and community led approaches? </p>\n<p>3. Taking action - what does appropriate development look like and how might we move towards creating leading examples in Oxford?</p>","excerpt":"We know there is potential for these sites, and yet there are many challenges to bringing them forward for development.
