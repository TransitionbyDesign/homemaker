*Finding creative and community-led ways to tackle housing need in Oxford*

## About this repository

This repository uses [Gatsby][1] to statically generate the Homemaker
Oxford website using a rendered combination of react components and
markdown files. It is preconfigured to work with Forestry as a way to
manage the content. Forestry makes changes by editing markdown or data
files, uploading media to the correct directory and committing these
updates to your repo directly.

Updates to the site, whether indirectly via Forestry.io or directly
via commits to the `master` branch, are published through Github
Pages.
