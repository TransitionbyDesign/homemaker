In November 2020, we gathered a group of housing providers, homelessness support agencies, and representatives form the community-led housing sector to explore what role community led housing might play in housing those that need it most.

The session will start with a short ‘food-for-thought’ presentation by Angelique Retief who has recently completed a piece of research on behalf of Black South West Network on housing BAME communities in Bristol using a community-led approach.

The conversation is then split into 3 parts;

• Designing with people rather than for them

• Ownership & ‘hackability’

• Housing as a service not a product

Since this recording was made, the Oxfordshire Community Land Trust have made progress on their 'Dean Court' development which will build eight cooperatively managed homes for people coming from the housing register.
