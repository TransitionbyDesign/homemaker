  "text": "<p>In October 2017, <a href=\"http://www.transitionbydesign.org\">Transition by Design</a> began work on a three-year grant-funded action research project called Homemaker Oxford. Driven‌ ‌by‌ ‌the‌ ‌dual‌ ‌issues‌ ‌of‌ ‌a‌ ‌rise‌ ‌in‌ ‌homelessness‌ ‌and‌ ‌the‌ ‌prevalence‌ ‌of‌ ‌empty‌ ‌and‌ ‌underused‌ ‌space‌ ‌in‌ ‌Oxford,‌ ‌we‌ ‌set‌ ‌out‌ ‌to‌ ‌explore‌ ‌how‌ ‌such‌ ‌spaces‌ ‌might‌ ‌be‌ ‌put‌ ‌to‌ ‌good‌ ‌use‌ ‌providing‌ ‌housing ‌for‌ ‌people without a home.‌</p><p>Homemaker focusses on the complex and stubborn gap created by a lack of social housing, expensive private rents, and the rising number of people who are homeless. We’re using design research and rapid prototyping alongside our knowledge of community-led housing to populate this gap with truly-affordable, locally rooted, and well-designed homes.</p><p>Homemaker will run until July 2021</p>"
