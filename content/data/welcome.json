  "text": "<p><em>Could Oxford’s empty and underused spaces become great homes for some of those who most need them?</em></p><p>Welcome to Homemaker Oxford, research in motion from architecture and design cooperative Transition by Design. We’re exploring how empty, underused and unusual spaces in Oxford might help us tackle housing need, providing decent, secure and truly affordable new homes.</p><p>Our research focusses on medium-term ‘move-on’ accommodation for people with low or no support needs. We’re focussing on providing high-quality bridging accommodation for people on their way out of a spell of homelessness, but we’re also looking further, to a fairer housing system that works for all.</p><p>Click through to our interactive map to explore research and ideas from our two-years spent exploring housing need in Oxford and creative and community-led solutions. You can explore the findings from our research, or offer your own experience and expertise. You can see the new ideas we’re suggesting for new homes in Oxford, or create your own.</p><p>Whether you are a housing professional, a homelessness service provider, a charity or campaigning organisation, someone looking to improve their own housing, a landlord or building manager, or an interested individual wanting to find out more, we hope this site will spike your interest and help you think about housing and homelessness in a fresh light. </p><p><em>We know that a home won’t ‘solve’ homelessness. But it’s a good place to start.</em> So come on in and help us get started.</p>"
