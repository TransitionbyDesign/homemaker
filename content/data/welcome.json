  "text": "<p>Welcome to Homemaker Oxford, research in motion from architecture and design cooperative Transition by Design. We’re exploring how empty, underused and unusual spaces in Oxford might provide decent, secure and truly affordable new homes for people in housing need.</p><p>Our research focusses on medium-term ‘move-on’ accommodation for people with low or no support needs. We’re focussing on providing high-quality bridging accommodation for people on their way out of a spell of homelessness, but we’re also looking further, to a fairer housing system which works for all.</p><p>Click through to our interactive map to explore findings from our two-years spent learning about housing need in Oxford and the creative and community-led solutions to our city's housing problems. You can read the findings from our research, or offer your own experience and expertise. You can explore our ideas for new homes in Oxford, or create your own.</p><p>Whether you are a housing professional, a homelessness service provider, from a charity or campaigning organisation, someone looking to improve their own housing, a landlord or building manager, or an interested individual wanting to find out more, we hope this site will give you practical ideas and help you think about housing and homelessness in a fresh light.</p><p><em>We know that a home won’t ‘solve’ homelessness. But it’s a good place to start.</em> So come on in and get involved.</p>"
