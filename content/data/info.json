  "welcome_title": "Down and Out in Paris and London",
  "welcome_text": "<p>The eight shillings lasted three days and four nights. After my bad <br>experience in the Waterloo Road I moved eastward, and spent the next <br>night in a lodging-house in Pennyfields. This was a typical lodging-house, <br>like scores of others in London. It had accommodation for between fifty and <br>a hundred men, and was managed by a 'deputy'--a deputy for the owner, <br>that is, for these lodging-houses are profitable concerns and are owned by <br>rich men. We slept fifteen or twenty in a dormitory; the beds were again <br>cold and hard, but the sheets were not more than a week from the wash, <br>which was an improvement. The charge was ninepence or a shilling (in the <br>shilling dormitory the beds were six feet apart instead of four) and the <br>terms were cash down by seven in the evening or out you went. <br> <br>[*It is a curious but well-known fact that bugs are much commoner <br>in south than north London. For some reason they have not yet crossed <br>the river in any great numbers.] <br> <br>Downstairs there was a kitchen common to all lodgers, with free firing <br>and a supply of cooking-pots, tea-basins, and toasting-forks. There were <br>two great clinker fires, which were kept burning day and night the year <br>through. The work of tending the fires, sweeping the kitchen and making the <br>beds was done by the lodgers in rotation. One senior lodger, a fine <br>Norman-looking stevedore named Steve, was known as 'head of the house', and <br>was arbiter of disputes and unpaid chucker-out. <br> <br>I liked the kitchen. It was a low-ceiled cellar deep underground, very <br>hot and drowsy with coke fumes, and lighted only by the fires, which cast <br>black velvet shadows in the comers. Ragged washing hung on strings from the <br>ceiling. Red-lit men, stevedores mostly, moved about the fires with <br>cooking-pots; some of them were quite naked, for they had been laundering <br>and were waiting for their clothes to dry. At night there were games of nap <br>and draughts, and songs--' I'm a chap what's done wrong by my parents,' <br>was a favourite, and so was another popular song about a shipwreck. <br>Sometimes late at night men would come in with a pail of winkles they had <br>bought cheap, and share them out. There was a general sharing of food, and <br>it was taken for granted to feed men who were out of work. A little pale, <br>wizened creature, obviously dying, referred to as 'pore Brown, bin under <br>the doctor and cut open three times,' was regularly fed by the others. <br> <br>Two or three of the lodgers were old-age pensioners. Till meeting them <br>I had never realized that there are people in England who live on nothing <br>but the old-age pension often shillings a week. None of these old men had <br>any other resource whatever. One of them was talkative, and I asked him how <br>he managed to exist. He said: <br> <br>'Well, there's ninepence a night for yer kip--that's five an' <br>threepence a week. Then there's threepence on Saturday for a shave-- <br>that's five an' six. Then say you 'as a 'aircut once a month for sixpence <br>--that's another three'apence a week. So you 'as about four an' four-pence <br>for food an' bacca.' <br></p>"
