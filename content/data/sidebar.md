_Welcome to Homemaker Oxford, research in motion by Transition by Design. We're interested in how empty and underused spaces could be used to help tackle extreme housing need in Oxford. This map is an unfinished pin-board of our research  including what we've done, what we've learned, and what we think._

Homemaker Oxford began in late 2017, setting out to explore how empty and underused space in Oxford might be used to help tackle extreme housing need in the city. Funded by the [Reva and David Logan Foundation](https://www.loganfdn.org/), this three-year programme of action research was intended to ignite a conversion within the city about what it means to call Oxford home and how as a society we enable some of the most vulnerable amongst us to live well, and to generate some prototype solutions.

The research was designed to be inherently collaborative, communicative, and community-led and from the very first workshop (where we invited stakeholders from all backgrounds to help us co-create the research brief), weâ€™ve tried to build a community around our research, encouraging as many people as possible to feel able to talk about housing, and help imagine how we could do it better.
