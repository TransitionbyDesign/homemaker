As part of our research, we wanted to create a space where people from all different backgrounds and all different experiences of housing felt comfortable talking to each other about housing. As well as being a soft-research space for us, a space where we could test ideas and host conversations in a manner which made people feel comfortable, we also wanted to use our research to build something bigger. Keen to avoid simply extracting information and then disappearing, we wanted to use our energy and our resources to build resources and momentum behind Oxford's growing housing justice movement that would outlive our research.

We've written in detail about the thinking behind Open House [over on Medium](https://medium.com/@lucywarin/why-we-built-a-shop-that-doesnt-sell-anything-9e52ad1b5a5f), and The Lankelly Chase Foundation commissioned an independent [report on the learnings from Open House](https://transitionbydesign.org/articles/nobody-needs-to-feel-like-a-spare-part/), written for those who might want to replicate the project. In 2019 we were delighted to receive The Developer Magazine's inaugural Meanwhile Prize.
