_When the government_ [_announced quietly_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52637283) _in mid-May, amidst the furore surrounding the easing of lockdown measures, that funding for hotel stays for people rough sleeping was to be withdrawn, many asked ‘what next’? The people working to support those who are homeless or rough sleeping began casting around for ideas on what could be done to prevent people from ending up in poor or unsafe housing, or on the streets. So, what next?_

Last month, homelessness minister Luke Hall [wrote to local authorities](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/encourage-rough-sleepers-to-move-in-with-family-and-friends-government-tells-councils-66643?fbclid=IwAR3hlA1qTnZVwPTetH8tkenzetzqlqrhpQrwji5M7POynAgsxp3yMntwVvs) asking them to _“encourage people, where appropriate and possible, to return to friends and family”_. This is a strategy doomed to fail and highlights a worrying lack of understanding on behalf of the government as to the causes of homelessness.

Whilst no two people’s journeys into, or out of homelessness are the same, there is a single unifying experience: the lack of a decent, affordable and secure home. A house can’t always ‘solve’ homelessness, but it’s a good place to start. As the government grasps for empty rhetoric and piecemeal solutions, here are five ideas to give as many people in Oxford as possible a decent place to live, now.

These ideas don’t offer an alternative to the hard work that has started and must continue; to build social housing, to reconsider houses as _homes_ and not _assets_ and to reform the private rental sector. But they do offer hope for providing people with decent places to live in a manner which might inch us closer to longer-term reform. They draw on many well-tested precedents and follow the findings of our own research as to what might work for Oxford.
