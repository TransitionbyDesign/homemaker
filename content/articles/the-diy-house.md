In 2018 we began running a weekly class for Crisis Members called ‘How to Build a House’. Every week, in the basement workshop at Crisis Skylight in Oxford we’d spend 3-hours teaching architectural design, sketching, CAD, and the basics of community-led housing design to a wonderfully eclectic group of folks experiencing homelessness. Many of the practical sessions touched on plumbing, electrics, joinery, construction, and painting and decorating, and we were struck by how many of those in our group both had experience working in the trades, and also wanted to get back into that sort of work.

Many of those we worked with were living in what is known as ‘move-on’ accommodation, temporary or bridging homes that are offered to people who are leaving emergency accommodation such as a shelter, hostel, prison or an extended stay in hospital. It is generally considered as only for people with ‘_low or no support needs_’ meaning any problems that a person might have with their mental health or with drug and alcohol addictions are manageable by them with minimal support. Homelessness charities and housing providers often describe this as ‘_the temporary place before a forever home_’ (with some people moving on to Council homes, and most into private rented accommodation), but it rarely is. In many cases it is neither temporary nor leads to permanent housing.

A great deal of ‘move-on’ accommodation is of poor quality. People don’t invest their time in money which is temporary, which isn’t ‘theirs’. People don’t get much of a choice as to where they live or who they live with and buildings often have an institutional feel and are frequently targeted by criminals looking for people to exploit. In addition, these ‘temporary’ solutions often become people’s homes for years.

Whilst the intentions of move-on housing might be good - to get people away from the often-chaotic environment of emergency accommodation into somewhere more private and settled as quickly as possible - in reality, it often simply throws up a new set of challenges.

To do move-on housing well we need to ask ourselves some key questions:

* **How can a temporary home feel settled and nurturing?**
* **What can architecture and urban design offer to make supporting people in move-on accommodation easier?**
* **How can a physical building engage with what else is going on in someone’s life at a moment of transition to create a ‘home’?**
* **How does the system of move-on fit with a private rental sector (PRS) that is out of control and a chronic lack of social housing?**

In March 2020, the government initiated the ‘[Everybody In](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9057/)’ scheme, where anyone experiencing homelessness was offered a room for the duration of the Covid 19 pandemic. Making the most of the temporarily empty hotel and hostel rooms, Oxford City Council were able to [quickly clear the streets](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/news/article/1733/everyone_in_response_to_pandemic_halves_the_number_of_people_experiencing_rough_sleeping_in_oxfordshire) of people rough sleeping by providing settled accommodation in hotels to many of Oxford’s population of people considered ‘hidden homeless’.

In late Summer, as lockdown restrictions began to ease and hotels began to think about reopening, and unwilling to simply turf people from the hotels back onto the streets, Oxford City Council and the city’s housing and homelessness providers began casting around for new ideas. As well as an immediate need for ‘move-on’ accommodation, there was also the impending challenge of providing services throughout the Winter (a much busier period) without the ability to host people in dormitory accommodation, and with the need to socially distance. The city needed space.

The Homemaker team came together with [Makespace Oxford](https://makespaceoxford.org/) and [Aspire Oxford](https://www.aspireoxfordshire.org/) to explore how a row of five empty buildings, owned by a College and previously used as small hotels and B&B’s might be able to help. [Together, we housed sixteen people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-56086392), including a home just for women.

Whilst working with the people moving in and those people helping support them, we created a vision for what future projects like this could look like, we called it ‘the DIY House’. The DIY House uses the temporary nature of meanwhile leases on empty properties as a design feature rather than a flaw, it uses tenant’s skill sets to aid the project and build new skills and confidence, it creates work opportunities and meaningful uses of tenants’ time, it connects residents to local communities to provide a permanence beyond the house, and it makes the chance of actually moving on to more permanent and settled housing much more likely.

If you’re a housing provider thinking about how you might better provide move-on accommodation then we’d love to hear from you about your experience or how we might work together. [Please get in touch.](mailto:info@transitionbydesign.org)
