  The city is so small! The greenbelt is strangling us!'. This is part of the complexity
  of a housing market but that doesn't mean there aren't any sites. You just need

Oxford is known for its high house prices and you often hear that this is because of the scarcity of land. The demand for homes is far greater than the amount of homes there are to buy and so, with regular trains to London, the amount people are willing to pay for a house is going up and up.

When asked why this has happened, people often point to a map of the city and ask 'just where would we build? The city is so small! The greenbelt is strangling us!'. This is part of the complexity of a housing market but that doesn't mean there aren't any sites. You just need to know where to look.

Transition by Design recently did a piece of work for Oxford City Council to map out the locations of sites which contained empty garage blocks. You can see in the image below that most of the sites with empty garages (darker red) are in the outer fringes, in Blackbird Leys and Greater Leys. However, with an increasing push towards more active and environmentally-friendly forms of transport, there will increasingly be empty garage sites all across the city that could be repurposed and turned into homes.
