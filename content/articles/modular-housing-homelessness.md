There is much hope held, including by us, for a housing future which embraces modular construction. But is it all it's cracked up to be? The Centre for Homelessness Impact, part of the (What Works network of research centres) has been looking at the rise of modular housing and its potential for solving housing need.

In their report ['Insights into the use of modular housing in addressing homelessness](https://assets-global.website-files.com/59f07e67422cdf0001904c14/6267c9a0ddf4a9015075a4cb_CHI.Modular.housing.V8.pdf)', they find that construction type, number of units on a single site, and the characteristics of the cohort housed are they key determining success housing for modular housing. 

They found that difficulties in accessing sites was a key limitation alongside poor design for the often under-sized homes. They also found that many small homes intended as temporary did in fact become much more long term. 

They did however find many cases of modular homes working effectively to help alleviate the pressures of homelessness and their report and [accompanying webinar](https://vimeo.com/703629466) offer a valuable tool for anyone in Oxford exploring how modular housing could help tackle the city's housing need.
