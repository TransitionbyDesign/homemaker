Homemaker Oxford began in late 2017, setting out to explore how empty and underused space in Oxford might be used to help tackle extreme housing need in the city. Funded by the [Reva and David Logan Foundatio](https://www.loganfdn.org/)n, this three-year programme of action research was intended to ignite a conversion within the city about what it means to call Oxford home and how as a society we enable some of the most vulnerable amongst us to live well, and to generate some prototype solutions.

The research was designed to be inherently collaborative, communicative, and community-led and from the very first workshop (where we invited stakeholders from all backgrounds to help us co-create the research brief), we’ve tried to build a community around our research, encouraging as many people as possible to feel able to talk about housing, and help imagine how we could do it better.

Over three years we’ve run a year-long ‘design school’ for Members of Crisis Skylight, we’ve hosted workshops, exhibitions, panel discussions, and roundtables to bring different communities of people together to talk about housing and homelessness, and we’ve even [opened our own award-winning shop, selling nothing but stories](https://medium.com/@lucywarin/why-we-built-a-shop-that-doesnt-sell-anything-9e52ad1b5a5f). Along the way we’ve applied in-progress learning from our research to help [build a new accommodation centre for people rough sleeping](https://transitionbydesign.org/projects/floyds-row/), to [renovate three empty hotels into new move-on accommodation](https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18688476.guest-house-turned-homeless-hostel/), and to help communities think about [how our housing system can ‘build back better’ from the pandemic](https://medium.com/@lucywarin/five-ideas-to-tackle-housing-need-in-oxford-during-and-beyond-the-coronavirus-pandemic-376eec5dcdad).

Throughout all of this research we’ve been talking to people who don’t often get a say in their own housing, let alone on the housing system, and we’ve been listening carefully, and making a lot of notes.

Now, we’ve translated what we’ve heard into three ideas that we call ‘prototypes’. Each of these is an idea for using empty or underused space in Oxford to help tackle extreme housing need - to give a safe, warm, and affordable home to someone who needs it.

‘[The DIY House](https://homemakeroxford.org/map/the-diy-house-1)’ is a template for using empty buildings for the provision of high-quality bridging accommodation, 2-5 year homes for people trying to regain independence after a spell living in supported accommodation. ‘[Find the Gap](https://homemakeroxford.org/map/could-unloved-garage-sites-in-oxford-be-the-foundations-for-a-low-carbon-social-home-building-revolution)’ is an approach to unlocking small and tricky urban development sites by using community-power, architectural ingenuity, and modern methods of construction. And ‘[Room to Stay](https://homemakeroxford.org/map/room-to-stay)’ is a blueprint which uses ‘Cohousing’ as a model to think practically about how we could redesign homes and neighbourhoods to encourage fewer under-occupied homes.

In March 2020, we were about to embarque on 6 months of participatory workshops, taking our embryonic ideas, our favourite examples from elsewhere, and a lot of biscuits to many different rooms in Oxford to co-create with different communities of people. Instead, when the Pandemic hit we had to change our plans, taking some activity online, and doing what we could to use the knowledge we’d gathered to work with our partners to help those experiencing housing need during the pandemic.

Now, as the current funding for Homemaker Oxford draws to a close, we’ve built this website to share what we’ve heard in 3 years, and what we’re doing with that knowledge. On this website you can understand the thinking behind our ‘protoypes’, and the progress we’ve made in making them happen. We’ve got two active projects with the Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, [one in Littlemore](https://www.oclt.org.uk/projects/champion-way/) and [one in Blackbird Leys](https://transitionbydesign.org/articles/weve-won-funding-to-turn-unloved-plots-of-land-into-new-social-homes/) which are looking to build new low-carbon social-homes on vacant garage sites. We’re working with Aspire Oxford on their Becket St project to put the DIY House into practice, learning, growing and adapting it as we work alongside staff and residents.

Contained within this map, you’ll find a maze of ideas and an open invitation to get involved. This is research-in-motion and if you’ve got ideas for where it should go next then we’d love to hear from you.
