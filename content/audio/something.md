Les and Tony are good friends. They live together in supported
accommodation in Cowley, Les in a ground floor flat because he has
difficulty walking and Tony is his upstairs neighbour. The charity
which houses them has a policy of moving tenants every 2-years and Les
and Tony have no guarantee they will be moved together. Les and Tony
are both on the waiting list for Council accommodation but as single
men with no dependents and classed as ‘low-need’, their wait is likely
to be many years. In this audio clip, Les and Tony discuss their
pasts, periods spent rough sleeping or in temporary accommodation, and
how they feel about being moved to a new home.
